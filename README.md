jpacman-framework
=================

Pacman-like game used for teaching software testing.

Parts of the code are well tested, whereas others are left untested intentionally.
As a student in software testing, you can extend the test suite, or use the framework to build extensions in a test-driven way.
As a teacher, you can use the framework to create your own testing exercises.

I have developed and am using this code at a software testing course at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. Teachers interested in seeing the exercises I use there are invited to contact me. 

Other universities who have used this material include Antwerp, Eindhoven, and UBC (Vancouver).

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this framework, please do not hesitate to contact me.

If you have found a problem or have a feature request, please feel free to post an issue. If you have a solution for an issue, I look forward to your pull request, preferrably to the `snapshot` branch, in order to keep the `master` branch stable.
